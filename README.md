# Geometric_Surfaces
Code to generate certain geometric surfaces and to embed images onto surfaces.

## Generating_Surfaces

### CMC Surface

The **mean curvature** of a surface is the product of the **principle curvatures** and is denoted by *H*.

A surface is called a **CMC Surface** if it has constant mean curvature everywhere.

A special subset of a CMC Surface is when the surface has zero mean curvature everywhere. These surfaces are called **minimal surfaces**.

In this Python Notebook, we generate some of these surfaces (as well as some others) using Matplotlib.

## Mapping_Earth

The aim here was to practise embedding images onto a surface.
To use an image we used:

`import matplotlib.image as mpimg`

Therefore a PNG image was used.
